# Social-Network API

Testing the potential of a social-network API using noSQL (MongoDB)

## Description

This application contains many API calls that could be utilized in a social-network website, such as creating new users and comments ("thoughts") along with reactions to those thoughts.

## Installation

Clone the code from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mfcodingbc/social-network-api).

## Usage

After cloning the code from the GitHub repository, install the necessary npm libraries with the command `'npm install'`  
**Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine (along with an authorized account) for this to work!** If you do not have this, please check out the MongoDB website for details on installation: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Once all packages are installed, type in the command-line `npm start` to run the application and start up the server.

Open up Insomnia (or other API call program) and make API calls to various GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes, including:

`'api/users'`  
`'api/thoughts'`
